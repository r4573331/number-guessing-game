# Number-Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

## Whatâ€™s This?  
Itâ€™s a super simple Java game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 10, and you try to guess what it is. If youâ€™re wrong, itâ€™ll tell you and let you guess again until you get it right. When you finally guess the correct number, itâ€™ll cheer you on. ðŸŽ‰

## How to Use It  
1. Make sure Java is installed on your computer. If itâ€™s not, download and install it first.  
2. Copy the code into a file and save it as `Main.java`.  
3. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and go to where you saved the file.  
4. Type this to compile it:  
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
5. Once thatâ€™s done, run it like this:  
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
6. Follow the prompts, guess a number, and see if youâ€™re lucky!

## Example Game  
Hereâ€™s what it looks like when you play:  
```
Can you guess the number from 1-10? 
6  
Incorrect! 6 is not the correct number!  
Try again  
9  
Correct! 9 is the correct number!  
```
